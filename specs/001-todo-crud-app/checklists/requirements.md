# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo App with CRUD Operations

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
- ✓ Specification is written in user-centric language without technical implementation details
- ✓ Focus is on WHAT users need (CRUD operations for todos) and WHY (task management and organization)
- ✓ Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
- ✓ All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and complete

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
- ✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete
- ✓ All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015) are specific and testable
- ✓ Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-007) include measurable time targets and quantifiable outcomes
- ✓ Success criteria avoid implementation details (e.g., "Users can create..." instead of "API endpoint returns...")
- ✓ Four user stories with comprehensive Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
- ✓ Edge cases section addresses boundary conditions and error scenarios
- ✓ Scope is clearly defined through the four user stories prioritized P1-P3
- ✓ Assumptions documented implicitly through requirement definitions (e.g., data persistence, session management)

### Feature Readiness - PASS
- ✓ Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✓ User scenarios cover all CRUD operations: Create (P1), Read/View (P1), Update (P2), Delete (P3)
- ✓ Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- ✓ Specification maintains abstraction from implementation throughout

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is ready for the next phase. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed as the user's description was sufficiently detailed, and reasonable defaults were applied where needed (e.g., case-sensitive "DELETE" requirement, data persistence behavior).

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan.
