# [PROJECT NAME] Development Guidelines

Auto-generated from all feature plans. Last updated: [DATE]

## Constitution

**IMPORTANT**: All development MUST follow `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

Key non-negotiable principles:
- **TDD Mandatory**: Write tests first (Red), implement (Green), refactor
- **Simplicity**: No over-engineering, YAGNI principle
- **Readability**: Functions <50 lines, complexity <10, meaningful names
- **Quality Gates**: 80%+ test coverage, zero linter warnings, code review required
